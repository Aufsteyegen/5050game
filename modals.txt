                        That's how many counties exist in the United States
                        + D.C.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Here's the game: Every day, there is a mystery county (equivalent to "parishes" in 
                        Louisiana and "boroughs" in Alaska) within each U.S. state. Input the name of any state, 
                        then guess the mystery county/parish/borough in as few guesses as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        First, each state you guess will appear on a map of the U.S. Its color indicates
                        how close it is to the answer; the <b style="color:red";>hotter</b> the color,
                        the closer you are. A <b style="color:green";>green</b> outline means you've
                        guessed correctly! This process repeats at the state-wide level for counties/parishes/boroughs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The number of times you can play each day is determined by your streak.
