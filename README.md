How to play:

Guess the year of statehood for 50 states in 50 seconds!
Incorrect guesses will flicker red. Correct guesses will disappear into the ether.</div>

If multiple states were admitted in a given year, the order in which each was admitted will appear
in parentheses.

For this game, "statehood" is either: 
1. the year a state ratified the 1787 Constitution, or 
2. the year a state was admitted per Act of Congress.

(It is not when (if) a state ratified the Articles of Confederation,
nor re-admittance to the Union after the Civil War.)
